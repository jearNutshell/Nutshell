# In-a-Nutshell

## Background
[Nutshell](https://nutshell.onrender.com) is a squirrel-themed interview planner. It allows you to schedule interviews on your personal calendar, assign yourself tasks for each of the interviews on the calendar and leave yourself personalized notes on each interview. A user is able to view all of their interviews on an index and from there, they can check out each interview's list of tasks on the dashboard. The application provides a user with a fun way to schedule and organize their job search process. 

## Technologies
